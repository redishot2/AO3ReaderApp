## What is the Archive Of Our Own?
The Organization for Transformative Works (OTW) is a nonprofit organization, established by fans in 2007, to serve the interests of fans by providing access to and preserving the history of fanworks and fan culture in its myriad forms. They believe that fanworks are transformative and that transformative works are legitimate.

The Archive of Our Own offers a noncommercial and nonprofit central hosting place for fanworks using open-source archiving software.
